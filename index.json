[{"content":"Two announcements this week felt like markers of a shift.\nn8n, the open-source automation platform, raised $180 million in Series C funding. And OpenAI introduced its Agent Builder, letting anyone create AI agents inside ChatGPT. Different origins — same direction: turning intelligence into action.\nFrom Models to Systems For past few years, AI progress was measured by bigger, smarter models. But real-world problems aren’t solved by a single prompt. They’re solved through flows — pulling data, judging conditions, handling exceptions, finishing tasks.\nThat’s not just intelligence; it’s orchestration. And this is where agents come in — systems that reason, act, and adapt.\nn8n’s Recent Raise n8n has quietly become the bridge between models and work. With this new funding, it’s betting on AI workflow orchestration: connecting APIs, evaluating results, and enabling feedback loops. That means automation that doesn’t just execute — it learns.\nIt’s a sign investors now value the plumbing of intelligence as much as the intelligence itself.\nOpenAI’s Agent Builder While n8n builds from the infrastructure layer up, OpenAI builds from the model layer down. Its Agent Builder and AgentKit turn ChatGPT into a platform for small, task-driven agents — connecting reasoning to real actions.\nOpenAI, n8n, and others like ByteDance’s Coze are converging toward the same goal: usable, reliable, self-improving automation.\nWhy This Matters AI doesn’t fail because it’s dumb — it fails because it’s disconnected. We don’t just need smarter models; we need systems that know when to act, when to stop, and how to learn.\nAgent automation brings:\nContext — linking steps across data and APIs Evaluation — knowing what works and what fails Governance — boundaries, monitoring, and human oversight These layers are what make AI useful in real businesses.\nA Personal Reflection For me, this shift is exciting because it reframes the challenge. It’s no longer “Can we make models think?” but “Can we make them do — safely, transparently, and meaningfully?”\nMaybe the next big leap won’t come from another foundation model. It’ll come from agents that quietly, intelligently, make work flow.\nStay hungry, stay foolish — and keep building.\n","permalink":"https://www.hungryfool.net/posts/agent-rising-turn-intelligence-into-action/","summary":"AI workflow automation company n8n\u0026rsquo;s $180M series-c funding and OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s recent announcement of Agent Builder show that industry values the plumbing of intelligence as much as the intelligence itself.","title":"Agents Rising: Turning Intelligence into Action"},{"content":"I stumbled upon a paper this week called “Psychologically Enhanced AI Agents”, and it got me thinking: what if AI really had personality — not just polite tones or emojis, but an inner “way of thinking”?\nThe authors built something called MBTI-in-Thoughts (MiT) — basically, a way to give large language models different MBTI types through prompts. No fine-tuning, no extra data, just clever framing. You tell the model it’s an INFJ or an ENTP, then see if it actually behaves that way. Turns out, it kind of does.\nFeeling types write warmer, more emotional stories. Thinking types stay logical and consistent in planning tasks. Introverts are a bit more reflective, while extroverts are chattier and more flexible in group settings. It’s not magic — the model’s still the same underneath — but the patterns are surprisingly human-like.\nWhat I found most interesting isn’t the technical side, but the psychological echo. These “personalities” affect how the AIs cooperate, argue, or make choices. Even without any “real” self, they start to feel more relatable, or at least more understandable. It’s like giving structure to their chaos — and maybe to ours too.\nOf course, MBTI isn’t perfect science. Psychologists have debated its reliability for years. But even if it’s a rough framework, it’s a familiar language for thinking about differences — human or artificial.\nFor me, this paper isn’t about proving that AI can “feel.” It’s about designing intention: how we choose to make AI think, reason, and respond. Maybe one day, we’ll switch between AI personalities depending on what we need — a calm INFJ coach, a bold ENTJ strategist, or a curious INTP brainstormer.\nIt’s a strange thought, but also kind of beautiful. Maybe personality — human or machine — is just a lens for how we see the world, and how we choose to care about it.\n","permalink":"https://www.hungryfool.net/posts/agent-with-mbti-personality/","summary":"Researchers found that enhancing AI agents with MBTI personality can enhance the way agents act and make them more suitable for tasks in various scenarios.","title":"Agent With MBTI Personality"},{"content":"Every new experience in the computer world starts with the famous \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo;.\nSo here is the \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; for my blog.\n","permalink":"https://www.hungryfool.net/posts/helloworld/","summary":"First post using Hugo.","title":"Hello World"}]
