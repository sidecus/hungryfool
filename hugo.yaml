    Title: Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
    Content: |
      The phrase comes from Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford commencement address — originally borrowed from The Whole Earth Catalog.
      Two decades later, it still says everything that matters: stay curious, keep learning, and don't be afraid to look foolish.
      You can revisit the full speech on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiHZqamCD8c) — it's still worth every minute.

      That spirit is what this space is about — a place to think aloud, build things, and learn.

      Welcome to **hungryfool.net**.
